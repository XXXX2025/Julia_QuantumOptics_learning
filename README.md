Cavity cooling of a two-level atom

My target: 
Here, I want to study if the superradiant emission can be implemented for cavity cooling.
First, I found a Julia module, called Quantum Optics, already packaged a code for it. The official website is: https://docs.qojulia.org/examples/cavity-cooling/#Cavity-cooling-of-a-two-level-atom.
What I am doing here is to understand it and use it for my purpose.

Physical picture:
Cavity cooling relies on spontaneous emission of an atom that is coupled to a field that has a certain energy mismatch. The atomic motion then compensates for the missing energy. Basic concept is similar to sisyphus cooling. In the cavity, there is a lattice built, which introduced a position dependent light shift. When the atoms move in one direction, it has probabliy to pump up to the excited state with red-detuning. While they decayed to the ground state, they emit the photon energy is more than they absorp. So that, the energy difference has to be transform from atoms moment energy.

A nice review, called "Cold atoms in cavity-generated dynamical optical potentials", can be found in: https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.85.553 and also arxiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0013

Reading time: (this is used to write something I learned instead of writing on papers)
The motion of cold and ultracold atoms coupled to the radiation field within a high-finesse cavity in the dispersive regime.
The optical dipole force, the back0action of atomic motion on the light field gives rise to a complex non linear coupled dynamis.

The emited cavity field allows for real-time monitoring the atoms position. 

For many-body systems, the optical cavity controllable long-range atom-atom interactions, which set the stage for collective phenomena. Correlated motion of distant particels. QUantum degenerate gases emulated opto-mechanics as well as novel quantum phases like supersolids and spin glasses. 

I. introduction
laser, laser cooling, on resonant, spontaneous emissions. off resonant, coherent scattering of phtons dominates and resulting light force, the dipole force ,can be derived from an optical potential proportionla to the laser intesnsity inducgin a Stark-shift. Back-action happens with photon bounce around in the cavity, it is one photon has been scattered twice with atom. Nonlinear effect. Coupling to further light modes gives rise to interferenece effects, which are the origino of collective instablitties and self-organization poheonmena. Photons leaking out of the cavity cause a damping of this coupled dynamics.Thes designeable decay channel cav be utilized to cool the motion of the mdium independent of its specific characterisitcs. the strong coudling regime where the coherent interaction between an atomic transition and a single radiation field mode dominates over all dissipation process. 

coolingand self-trapping of particles in the cavity field.
sub-recoil cooling has been achieved, which paves the way towards reaching quantum degeneracy without relying on evaporative cooling techniques.
Cavity cooling allows for slowing of any sufficiently polarizable particle with small absorption, without the need of a cycling transition.
