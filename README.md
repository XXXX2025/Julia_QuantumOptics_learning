Cavity cooling of a two-level atom

Basic concept is similar to sisyphus cooling. In the cavity, there is a lattice built, which introduced a position dependent light shift. When the atoms move in one direction, it has probabliy to pump up to the excited state with red-detuning. While they decayed to the ground state, they emit the photon energy is more than they absorp. So that, the energy difference has to be transform from atoms moment energy.

A nice review, called "Cold atoms in cavity-generated dynamical optical potentials", can be found in: https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.85.553 and also arxiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.0013

Other paper I am going to read and try to present here are listed:
1,"Cavity cooling of many atoms", https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.183601
2, "Cavity cooling of a single atom", https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02387#author-information
